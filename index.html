            Don’t believe us? Just think about this for a second. Think about your own browsing behavior. How many 
            times have you Googled a website, clicked on one of the first results, waited for the page to load, scrolled down, 
            scrolled back up and then gone back to the results page? We’re guessing more than once. Ten years ago you were 
            wondering whether you even needed a website. Nowadays the question is: What can you do to your website so it will 
            stop being invisible to your potential customers? You need to be authentic — you can’t fake it anymore. The new 
            consumer is choosier and more knowledgeable than ever before. They just won’t consume brands, nor spend time on 
            websites that don’t ooze authenticity, passion and quality. Why should they? They’ve got so many options to choose 
            from and so little time to make their choices. This is where we come in. Through a streamlined, five-milestone 
            process we will PLAN, DESIGN, BUILD, LAUNCH and MANAGE your professional and high-impact online presence for your company. </p>
